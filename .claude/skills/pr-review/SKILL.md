# PR Review

You are reviewing a pull request. Do the following, in order:

1. **Summary.** In three sentences, describe what this PR changes, what
   it's trying to achieve, and what it deliberately does not touch.

2. **Assumptions.** List the assumptions this code is making about the
   rest of the system. For each, note what would break if the assumption
   turned out to be wrong.

3. **Untested behaviours.** List the behaviours this PR introduces or
   changes. For each, note whether there is a test that would fail if
   the behaviour regressed.

4. **A second angle.** Re-read the diff as if you were the person on-call
   this weekend. What would you want to know before approving?

Keep each section short. Quote specific lines or files where relevant.
